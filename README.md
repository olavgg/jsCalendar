jsCalendar
==========

Javascript Calendar, works inn all browsers, including IE6. Supports for multiple languages(English, Norwegian are in there) and custom styling. No additional javascript libraries needed. Not even jQuery.
Code should be easy to read and modify for your needs.

This is one of my first projects written many years ago. There is some code cleanup todo, for example adding styling from CSS classes, make it a little more good looking and making it easier to customize and integrate.
